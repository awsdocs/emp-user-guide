# Security in AWS End\-of\-Support Migration Program \(EMP\) for Windows Server<a name="emp-security"></a>

Cloud security at AWS is the highest priority\. As an AWS customer, you benefit from data centers and network architectures that are built to meet the requirements of the most security\-sensitive organizations\.

Security is a shared responsibility between AWS and you\. The [shared responsibility model](http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/) describes this as security *of* the cloud and security *in* the cloud:
+ **Security of the cloud** – AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs AWS services in the AWS Cloud\. AWS also provides you with services that you can use securely\. Third\-party auditors regularly test and verify the effectiveness of our security as part of the [AWS Compliance Programs](http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/programs/)\. To learn about the compliance programs that apply to Porting Assistant for \.NET, see [AWS Services in Scope by Compliance Program](http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/services-in-scope/)\.
+ **Security in the cloud** – Your responsibility is determined by the AWS service that you use\. You are also responsible for other factors including the sensitivity of your data, your company’s requirements, and applicable laws and regulations\. 

This documentation helps you understand how to apply the shared responsibility model when using AWS End\-of\-Support Migration Program \(EMP\) for Windows Server\. The following list contains information about how AWS End\-of\-Support Migration Program \(EMP\) for Windows Server helps you to meet your security and compliance objectives\.
+ **Migrates legacy applications from insecure EOS Windows versions to the latest secure versions**\. The EMP application packaging process captures only the legacy application components into an EMP package, not the legacy operating system components\. The package can then be deployed and run in isolation, and benefits from the enhanced security and performance of the modern operating system\. The modern operating system, in turn, runs on modern hardware, which also mitigates against hardware\-based vulnerabilities\. Because an EMP package is no longer dependent on the underlying operating system, it can run on a later version of Windows, including future semi\-annual Windows releases\. This ensures that you can take advantage of future security benefits and always run on a supported Windows version\.
+ **Application security updates\.** Applications contained in an EMP package can be patched with security updates provided by the application vendors by using the [ EMP Compatibility Package Editor](emp-manage.md)\.We recommend that you maintain packaged applications with their latest security updates to keep them as secure as possible in the AWS Cloud\.
+ **Application security vulnerabilities**\. EMP does not resolve inherent security vulnerabilities in legacy applications\. Because vulnerable applications benefit from the better security features of modern Windows servers, EMP reduces their exposure to exploitation\. Regularly updating EMP\-packaged applications with security updates where available is recommended to counter security vulnerabilities\.
