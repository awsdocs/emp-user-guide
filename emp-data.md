AWS collects usage information through the EMP telemetry module during the deployment and subsequent use of EMP packages\. The telemetry module sends the collected data to an application modernization metrics service running on AWS\. To view the data collected by the telemetry module, see [Data collected by the AWS End\-of\-Support Migration Program \(EMP\) for Windows Server ](emp-security-data.md) in the Security section of this guide\.
